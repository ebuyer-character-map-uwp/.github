<h2>Purpose of Character Map UWP</h2>
<p><strong>Character Map UWP</strong> is a modern, native UWP application for Windows, intended to replace the classic Win32 . It allows users to explore all fonts installed on the system (including variable, color, and web fonts), view all available glyphs (Unicode, symbols, icons), and copy or export individual characters for use in documents, code, design work or development. Its design supports high-DPI screens and touch input, making it suitable for modern Windows PCs and workflows.

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Font browsing - lists all installed font families and faces, with quick access to variable-font axes if supported.</li>
  <li>Unicode and glyph view - displays all glyphs available in a font: letters, symbols, special characters, icons, emoji, etc.</li>
  <li>Copy and export characters - copy glyphs to clipboard, export as code (e.g. XAML, FontIcon, SymbolIcon), or save as image (PNG) at selectable resolution - useful for design, development or documentation.</li>
  <li>Filter and search - filter fonts, show only symbol fonts, search for specific glyphs or browse by character category, making glyph lookup faster than classic charmap.</li>
  <li>Custom collections - create and manage collections of favorite fonts or glyphs for quick access, handy for designers or developers working with multiple font sets.
</ul>

<h2>Unique Strengths</h2>
<p>Unlike the built-in Windows Character Map, Character Map UWP handles modern typography and display needs: full support for high-DPI / scaling, variable fonts, color fonts and touch interaction. Its UI is updated and more usable on modern Windows (10/11), making it more convenient for designers, developers, typographers and anyone working with Unicode or icon fonts.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Character Map UWP suits graphic designers, UI/UX designers, front-end / desktop developers, typographers, translators, writers, and anyone needing access to full Unicode or symbol sets beyond basic keyboard characters. It is also useful for developers working with icon fonts or UI frameworks that support FontIcon/SymbolIcon code snippets.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Using Character Map UWP</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Free and open-source (MIT license) - no cost, no ads.</li>
  <li>Modern UI and improved usability on high-DPI displays and touch devices - more comfortable than legacy charmap.exe.</li>
  <li>Supports modern font formats (variable fonts, .WOFF, color fonts) and advanced typography needs.</li>
  <li>Flexible export options - copy glyphs, export code, save images - useful across different workflows (design, coding, publishing).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Modules / Components</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Font Browser Module</strong>: scan and list all fonts installed on system, categorize by family, variable fonts, symbolic fonts, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Glyph Viewer Module</strong>: display glyph grid for selected font, show Unicode codepoints, character names, search and filter.</li>
  <li><strong>Export / Copy Module</strong>: options to copy character to clipboard, export as PNG image, copy as code snippet (XAML, FontIcon, SymbolIcon) for developers.</li>
  <li><strong>Collections / Favorites Module</strong>: allow users to build custom collections of fonts or glyphs for easier reuse across projects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Platforms & Requirements</h2>
<p>Character Map UWP runs on Windows 10 and Windows 11 (x86, x64, ARM) as a UWP (Universal Windows Platform) application.</p>
<p>Because it is lightweight and native, it does not require powerful hardware - any modern PC that supports UWP apps and Windows 10/11 should run it smoothly.</p>

<h2>Licensing and Availability</h2>
<p>Character Map UWP is released under the MIT License and is freeware. It is available in the Microsoft Store, as well as via package managers such as WinGet.</p>

<h2>Usage Scenarios</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Selecting and copying special or non-Latin characters (Unicode, diacritics, symbols) for documents, text editors, or messaging.</li>
  <li>Working with icon fonts or symbol fonts in UI development - retrieving glyphs and exporting code or images for UI frameworks (e.g. XAML, HTML/CSS, FontIcon systems).</li>
  <li>Design and typography work - exploring font families, glyph sets, variable font axes, generating glyph previews or assets for graphic design or publishing.</li>
  <li>Localization, translation, or multilingual writing - easy access to rare characters, untypable symbols, or international alphabets. </li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Install and Use Character Map UWP</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open Microsoft Store (or use WinGet) and search for Character Map UWP or use ID '9WZDNCRDXF41'.</li>
  <li>Install the app - it is free and opens immediately after installation.</li>
  <li>Launch Character Map UWP. Browse the list of installed fonts or import custom fonts if needed (variable fonts, WOFF, color fonts, etc.).</li>
  <li>Select a font, open its glyph view - scroll or search for desired character or symbol.</li>
  <li>Click on a glyph to copy to clipboard, or choose to export as PNG or code snippet depending on your needs. Use filtering or search to quickly find symbol fonts or specific characters.</li>
  <li>Optionally create a custom collection (favorite fonts or glyphs) for reuse in design or development workflows. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes and Considerations</h2>
<p>Because Character Map UWP is a UWP application, it adheres to UWP sandbox and permission model. It does not require installation of system-wide drivers or modifications. However, users working with very old non-standard fonts or obscure legacy encodings may still need legacy tools or manual font handling.</p>
<p>While Character Map UWP excels for modern Unicode, symbol and font-heavy workflows, it is not a full font editor - it does not allow editing glyph shapes, font creation, or advanced typographic design. It focuses on glyph browsing, copying, exporting and font inspection.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Character Map UWP is an excellent modern alternative to the legacy Windows Character Map: free, open-source, lightweight, and adapted to contemporary Windows environments. Its support for modern font formats, Unicode glyph browsing, export options, and updated UI make it particularly useful for designers, developers, typographers, translators, and anyone needing reliable access to a full set of characters and symbols. For tasks ranging from simple symbol insertion to font-rich UI design or multilingual text work, Character Map UWP remains a highly practical and convenient tool.</p>
